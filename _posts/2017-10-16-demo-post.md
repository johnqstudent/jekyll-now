Every file needs to have `metadata` at the top of it, in order to be displayed. Jekyll now is expecting metadata. In this particular case, we're using YAML as the formatting. In essence: you need to specify layout, and title, as above.

> YAML is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as XML, but has taken a more minimal approach which intentionally breaks compatibility with SGML. YAML 1.2 is a superset of JSON, another minimalist data serialization format where braces and brackets are used instead of indentation.
